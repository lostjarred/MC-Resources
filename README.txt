====---- MC-Textures ----====
A collection of textures I have made for mods/modpacks, feel free to use just credit me is all I ask

==-- Formats --==
just some small notes about some format you may find

| .pdn | Paint.net format - defualt save
| .xcf | GIMP format - default save
| .psd | Photoshop - I generally use this when transfering from GIMP to Paint.net
| .png | the format minecraft uses for its textures, generally the finished texture or at least at a level I want to see how it looks ingame
